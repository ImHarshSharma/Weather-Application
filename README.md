# Weather-Application With REAL-TIME API

Hello, I'm Harsh, and I'm excited to present my college's major project. This project represents the culmination of my last year's efforts. My primary goal with this project is to create a responsive and dynamic weather application website featuring a real-time API. Users can simply input a city name, and in return, they will receive the current weather along with date and time information.

Here's the tech stack I employed for this project:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Bootstrap 4
Real-time API integration
Node.js
Express.js
The project consists of the following key sections:

Home: The landing page of the website.
Weather: This section allows users to search for weather information by typing in a city name.
About: Here, you can find information about the project and its creator.
404 Error Page: In case a user requests a page that doesn't exist, a custom 404 error page has been included to provide a better user experience.
Feel free to explore the website and experience real-time weather updates for any city of your choice.
